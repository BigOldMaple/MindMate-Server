# Completed Implementation Plan: Mental Health Monitoring and Peer Support System

## All Components Completed ✅

### 1. Mental Health State Database Schema ✅
- Created MongoDB schema to track user's mental health state
- Implemented fields for mental health status tracking (stable, declining, critical)
- Added confidence score and reasoning data structure
- Designed support request tracking with tiered approach
- Created database indexes for efficient querying
- Added helper methods for common queries (findLatestForUser, findUsersNeedingSupport)
- Established proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 2. LLM Selection and Configuration ✅
- Selected Gemma 3 1B as the appropriate model for mental health assessment
- Downloaded Ollama and interacted with the model in command line
- Set up proper configuration for LLM communication
- Configured IPv4 connectivity to prevent connection issues

### 3. LLM Integration Architecture ✅
- Created Node.js service that interfaces with Ollama (llmAnalysisService.ts)
- Built data collection pipeline for health metrics
- Implemented pre-processing to calculate average metrics (sleep, activity, mood)
- Developed response parsing and validation logic
- Built comprehensive prompt templates for mental health analysis
- Implemented confidence scoring and support need detection
- Added type conversion for LLM responses to ensure MongoDB compatibility
- Created merging logic to handle missing or invalid fields in responses

### 4. Mental Health API Routes ✅
- Implemented API endpoints for retrieving and triggering assessments
- Created history and statistics endpoints
- Built support request management endpoints
- Added admin routes for baseline establishment and batch analysis
- Implemented a route to clear mental health data for development purposes
- Connected API routes to server infrastructure

### 5. Development User Interface ✅
- Created "Trigger Analysis" button component for development testing
- Implemented "Clear Mental Health Data" button for cleaning test data
- Integrated buttons into home screen

### 6. Support Request System ✅
- Implemented tiered support structure with Buddy, Community, and Global peers
- Created support request state machine with appropriate transitions
- Developed timeout mechanism for escalation between tiers
- Built request tracking and matching algorithm
- Created support session management with chat functionality

### 7. Baseline Establishment Process ✅
- Built specialized LLM prompts for baseline analysis

### 8. User Interfaces for Mental Health Insights ✅
- Designed and implemented Mental Health Dashboard
- Created historical trend visualization components
- Implemented LLM-generated insights display
- Added support request 


### 10. LLM Training and Optimization ✅
- Optimized prompt templates for improved accuracy
- Implemented confidence thresholds to reduce false positives


## System Overview

The Mental Health Monitoring and Peer Support System is now fully implemented. It successfully leverages React Native Health Connect data, LLM analysis, and a tiered community support framework to provide automated mental health monitoring and peer support.

The system collects health metrics, establishes personalized baselines, performs daily comparative analysis, and triggers appropriate support mechanisms when needed. The peer support system efficiently routes support requests through multiple tiers, ensuring users receive timely assistance.
