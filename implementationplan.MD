Implementation Plan: Mental Health Monitoring and Peer Support System
System Overview
This implementation plan outlines how to create an automated mental health monitoring and peer support system that leverages React Native Health Connect data, LLM analysis, and a tiered community support framework.
Core Components
1. Mental Health State Database Schema
Create a new database collection to track the user's mental health state:

Schema Fields:

userId (reference to user)
timestamp (when assessment was made)
mentalHealthStatus (stable, declining, critical)
confidenceScore (LLM's assessment confidence)
reasoningData (specific health metrics that influenced decision)
needsSupport (boolean flag)
supportRequestStatus (none, buddyRequested, communityRequested, globalRequested, supportProvided)
supportRequestTime (when support was first initiated)
supportProvidedBy (reference to helper)
supportProvidedTime (when help was provided)



2. LLM Integration Architecture
Data Processing Pipeline

Data Collection Service:

Scheduled job that retrieves relevant health metrics from MongoDB
Formats data appropriately for LLM analysis
Maintains context of historical baselines


Baseline Establishment Process:

Triggered during user onboarding
Collects 2-4 weeks of initial data
Submits to LLM with specialized baseline prompt
Stores baseline metrics for future comparison


Daily Analysis Process:

Scheduled job runs once daily
Collects latest 24-hours of health data
Retrieves user's baseline and recent history
Submits to LLM with comparative analysis prompt
Stores assessment results and triggers support system if needed



3. LLM Prompt Engineering
Design two specialized prompts:

Baseline Establishment Prompt:

Identifies normal patterns across all health metrics
Establishes personalized thresholds for sleep, activity, etc.
Creates correlation map between different metrics
Produces structured output for database storage


Daily Comparison Prompt:

Compares current metrics against baseline
Identifies significant deviations
Provides confidence score for assessment
Returns structured reasoning for triggering support
Includes relevant data points that led to decision



4. Peer Support System
Support Tiers Structure

Primary Tier: "Buddy Peers"

User-selected trusted connections
First to receive support requests
Given 30-minute response window


Secondary Tier: "Community Peers"

Users from same communities/groups
Activated if buddy tier doesn't respond
Given 30-60 minute response window


Tertiary Tier: "Global Peers"

All compatible users platform-wide
Final escalation point
Gradually requests support from all users on the platform to not send them all out at once


Support Request State Machine

States: Initiated → BuddyRequested → CommunityRequested → GlobalRequested → SupportProvided
Transitions: Triggered by timeouts or positive responses
Persistence: State maintained in database
Completion: Recorded when help acknowledged

5. Notification System

Push Notification Service:

Alerts potential helpers about support requests
Delivers context-appropriate information
Provides accept/decline options


Mental Health Insights Screen:

Current status visualization
Historical trend display
Key metric highlights
LLM-generated insights
